# Deployment Guide - Automated Release Process

## Overview

The Vacasa Home Assistant Integration uses a fully automated deployment process that handles the entire release workflow from development branch to production release on GitHub and HACS distribution.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Update version and changelog on development branch
# 2. Commit all changes
# 3. Run the automated deployment
./deploy.sh
```

That's it! The script handles everything automatically.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub CLI (gh)** - GitHub API access
- **Python 3.9+** - For version validation scripts
- **Pre-commit** - Code quality hooks (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install gh

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install gh

   # Windows
   winget install GitHub.CLI
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Verify Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   git status
   ```

## üì¶ Release Process

### Step 1: Prepare Release on Development Branch

1. **Update Version Information**:
   ```bash
   # Update VERSION file
   echo "1.4.0" > VERSION

   # Update manifest.json version
   # Edit custom_components/vacasa/manifest.json
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## [1.4.0] - 2025-XX-XX

   ### Added
   - New feature descriptions

   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix descriptions

   ### Changed
   - Change descriptions
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add VERSION custom_components/vacasa/manifest.json CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.4.0"
   ```

### Step 2: Execute Automated Deployment

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Validate prerequisites and environment
- ‚úÖ Check version consistency across files
- ‚úÖ Run tests and pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ Push development branch to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Wait for CI/CD validation to complete
- ‚úÖ Create pull request from development to main
- ‚úÖ Wait for PR checks and merge automatically
- ‚úÖ Trigger GitHub release workflow
- ‚úÖ Monitor release completion
- ‚úÖ Verify release creation and main branch update
- ‚úÖ Switch back to development branch

---

## üîç What the Script Does

### Phase 1: Validation
- Checks if GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
- Verifies you're on the development branch
- Ensures working directory is clean
- Validates version consistency between VERSION file and manifest.json
- Confirms CHANGELOG.md has entry for the new version

### Phase 2: Testing
- Runs pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Executes pytest if available
- Ensures all tests pass before proceeding

### Phase 3: Development Branch Deployment
- Pushes latest development branch changes to GitHub
- Waits for CI/CD workflows to complete successfully
- Validates all GitHub Actions pass (linting, testing, HACS validation)

### Phase 4: Main Branch Integration
- Creates pull request from development to main branch
- Waits for PR status checks to complete
- Automatically merges the PR when all checks pass

### Phase 5: Release Creation
- Switches to main branch and pulls latest changes
- Triggers GitHub release workflow via `gh workflow run`
- Monitors release workflow progress
- Waits for successful completion

### Phase 6: Verification & Cleanup
- Verifies GitHub release was created successfully
- Checks that main branch version matches release version
- Switches back to development branch
- Displays success summary with release links

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Steps (If Needed)

### Emergency Manual Release

If the automated script fails, you can manually execute the process:

```bash
# 1. Push development branch
git push origin development

# 2. Create PR manually
gh pr create --base main --head development --title "Release vX.X.X"

# 3. Merge PR after checks pass
gh pr merge --merge

# 4. Trigger release workflow
git checkout main && git pull
gh workflow run release.yml --field version="vX.X.X"

# 5. Monitor release
gh run list --workflow=release.yml
```

### Rollback Process

If a release needs to be rolled back:

```bash
# 1. Delete the GitHub release
gh release delete vX.X.X

# 2. Delete the git tag
git tag -d vX.X.X
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.X.X

# 3. Revert main branch if needed
git checkout main
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

## üìä Monitoring and Validation

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The deployment process triggers several workflows:
- **CI Workflow**: Linting, testing across Python versions, security scans
- **Dependencies Workflow**: Dependency monitoring and updates
- **Release Workflow**: Version validation, HACS validation, release creation

### Release Artifacts

Successful releases create:
- GitHub release with changelog and downloadable assets
- Git tag (vX.X.X format)
- Release archive (vacasa-X.X.X.zip)
- Updated main branch with version bump

### HACS Integration

After release:
- HACS automatically detects new releases
- Users receive update notifications
- Integration becomes available for easy installation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "GitHub CLI not authenticated"
```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

#### "Working directory not clean"
```bash
git status
git add . && git commit -m "cleanup"
# or
git stash
```

#### "Version mismatch between files"
- Ensure VERSION file and manifest.json have the same version
- Check CHANGELOG.md has an entry for the new version

#### "CI/CD workflows failed"
- Check GitHub Actions tab for specific error details
- Fix failing tests or linting issues
- Re-run the deployment script

#### "PR merge failed due to branch protection"
- Ensure branch protection rules allow the merge
- Check that all required status checks pass
- May need admin privileges for protected main branch

### Debug Mode

For verbose output during deployment:
```bash
# Enable bash debug mode
bash -x ./deploy.sh
```

### Logs and Monitoring

Monitor deployment progress:
```bash
# Watch GitHub Actions
gh run list --limit 10

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# Check releases
gh release list
```

## üîß Customization

### Script Configuration

Edit `deploy.sh` to modify:
- Branch names (REQUIRED_BRANCH, TARGET_BRANCH)
- Timeout values for CI/CD waiting
- PR template and release notes format
- Validation requirements

### Workflow Integration

The script integrates with GitHub Actions workflows:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release automation
- `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml` - Dependency monitoring

---

## üìà Best Practices

### Version Management
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update CHANGELOG.md for every release
- Keep VERSION file and manifest.json in sync

### Development Workflow
- Always work on development branch
- Test thoroughly before releasing
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format

### Release Schedule
- Release regularly with small, focused changes
- Test releases in staging environment first
- Monitor community feedback after releases
- Keep release notes comprehensive and user-friendly
