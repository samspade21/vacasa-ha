# Product Context: Vacasa Home Assistant Integration

## Problem Statement
Vacation rental owners who use Vacasa property management services and Home Assistant for home automation face a significant challenge: there's no direct way to automate their smart home based on reservation status. This disconnect leads to:

1. **Energy Waste**: Heating/cooling systems running unnecessarily when properties are vacant
2. **Missed Opportunities**: Inability to create personalized experiences for guests
3. **Manual Intervention**: Constantly checking the Vacasa portal to know when to adjust settings
4. **Inconsistent Preparation**: Different stay types (guest, owner, maintenance) require different preparations

## Solution Overview
The Vacasa Home Assistant Integration solves these problems by creating Home Assistant calendars that reflect real-time reservation data from Vacasa. This enables:

1. **Automated Energy Management**: Adjust climate settings based on occupancy status
2. **Enhanced Guest Experience**: Prepare the property automatically for guest arrivals
3. **Owner Control**: Apply different settings for owner stays versus guest bookings
4. **Maintenance Coordination**: Prepare differently for maintenance visits

## User Journey

### Setup Experience
1. User installs the custom component in Home Assistant
2. User configures the integration with their Vacasa credentials
3. The integration discovers all properties in the user's Vacasa account
4. Calendars are automatically created for each property
5. User creates automations based on calendar events

### Ongoing Experience
1. Integration refreshes calendar data periodically (default: every 4 hours)
2. Home Assistant automations trigger based on calendar events
3. Property responds automatically to different stay types
4. User can view upcoming reservations in Home Assistant

## Key Differentiators

### Compared to Manual Checking
- **Automation**: No need to manually check the Vacasa portal
- **Precision**: Exact check-in/check-out times for automations
