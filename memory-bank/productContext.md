# Product Context: Vacasa Home Assistant Integration

## Problem Statement
Vacation rental owners who use Vacasa property management services and Home Assistant for home automation face a significant challenge: there's no direct way to automate their smart home based on reservation status. This disconnect leads to:

1. **Energy Waste**: Heating/cooling systems running unnecessarily when properties are vacant
2. **Missed Opportunities**: Inability to create personalized experiences for guests
3. **Manual Intervention**: Constantly checking the Vacasa portal to know when to adjust settings
4. **Inconsistent Preparation**: Different stay types (guest, owner, maintenance) require different preparations

## Solution Overview
The Vacasa Home Assistant Integration solves these problems by creating reliable Home Assistant calendars and occupancy sensors that reflect real-time reservation data from Vacasa. This enables:

1. **Automated Energy Management**: Adjust climate settings based on reliable occupancy status
2. **Enhanced Guest Experience**: Prepare the property automatically for guest arrivals with confidence
3. **Owner Control**: Apply different settings for owner stays versus guest bookings
4. **Maintenance Coordination**: Prepare differently for maintenance visits
5. **Reliable Automation**: Trust that occupancy detection works consistently without manual intervention
6. **Real-time Status**: Know immediately when reservation status changes

## User Journey

### Setup Experience
1. User installs the custom component in Home Assistant
2. User configures the integration with their Vacasa credentials
3. The integration discovers all properties in the user's Vacasa account
4. Calendars are automatically created for each property
5. User creates automations based on calendar events

### Ongoing Experience
1. Integration refreshes calendar data periodically (default: every 4 hours) with intelligent caching
2. Binary sensors provide immediate occupancy status with reliable timing coordination
3. Home Assistant automations trigger based on calendar events and occupancy sensors
4. Property responds automatically to different stay types with enhanced reliability
5. User can view upcoming reservations in Home Assistant with accurate current event detection
6. System self-recovers from temporary issues automatically
7. Clean, maintainable logging provides insight when needed without noise
