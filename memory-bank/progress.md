## Resolved Issues

1. **Occupancy Detection Timing (RESOLVED in v1.3.0)**
   - **Previous Issue**: Binary sensors sometimes showed incorrect state due to startup timing
   - **Solution**: Enhanced startup coordination and event-driven recovery mechanisms
   - **Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - occupancy detection now works reliably

2. **Calendar Entity Coordination (RESOLVED in v1.3.0)**
   - **Previous Issue**: Race conditions between calendar and binary sensor initialization
   - **Solution**: Platform dependencies and graceful availability handling
   - **Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - entities coordinate properly

3. **Current Event Detection (RESOLVED in v1.3.0)**
   - **Previous Issue**: Calendar logic for detecting active vs future reservations
   - **Solution**: Corrected datetime comparison logic for current reservations
   - **Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - current events properly detected

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Token Expiration**
   - Tokens expire after approximately 10 minutes
   - Current solution: Refresh before expiration
   - Status: ✅ STABLE - handled reliably with proper retry logic

2. **API Stability**
   - Vacasa API is not officially documented
   - Current solution: Robust error handling with graceful degradation
   - Status: ✅ STABLE - monitoring for changes, well-handled

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Unknown if Vacasa API has rate limits
   - Current solution: Conservative refresh interval with exponential backoff
   - Status: ✅ STABLE - no issues observed, handled preventively
