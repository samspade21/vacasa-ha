# Active Context: Vacasa Home Assistant Integration

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the Vacasa Home Assistant integration that can:
1. Authenticate with Vacasa using username/password
2. Extract and manage authentication tokens
3. Retrieve property information
4. Fetch and categorize reservations by stay type
5. Create calendar entities for each property
6. Provide binary sensors for property occupancy status with reliable timing
7. Support configurable check-in/check-out times

The integration is fully compatible with Home Assistant's async architecture and includes:
- Token caching and refresh
- Robust error handling with retries
- Secure credential management
- Efficient API usage
- User-friendly configuration flow
- **Enhanced startup coordination** for binary sensors
- **Event-driven recovery mechanisms** for reliable operation
- **Corrected calendar logic** for current vs future event detection
- **Production-ready logging** with clean, maintainable output

## Debugging Techniques

### SSH Access for Log Viewing
To access Home Assistant logs for debugging:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.67 "cat /homeassistant/home-assistant.log | grep -i 'vacasa.*debug' | tail -n 100"
```

This command can be modified with different grep patterns:
- For errors: `grep -i 'vacasa.*error'`
- For tracebacks: `grep -i 'vacasa.*error\|traceback'`
- For all Vacasa logs: `grep -i 'vacasa'`

This technique can be used in Plan mode to diagnose issues before implementing fixes.

## Active Decisions

### Calendar Implementation
We've implemented one calendar per Vacasa property, with events categorized by stay type. This approach:
- Allows for property-specific automations
- Enables filtering by stay type
- Provides a clean, organized UI

### Occupancy Sensors
We've added binary sensors for property occupancy status, which:
- Simplify automation creation based on occupancy
- Provide additional context through attributes
- Work alongside calendars for comprehensive property status

### Check-in/Check-out Times
We've implemented configurable check-in/check-out times that:
- Default to standard times (4 PM check-in, 10 AM check-out)
- Can be customized per property
- Fall back to API data when available
- Handle placeholder times appropriately

### Refresh Strategy
We've implemented a default refresh interval, which:
- Balances freshness of data with API usage
- Can be configured by the user
- Includes a manual refresh service

## Next Steps

1. **Final Release Preparation (v1.3.0)**
   - Update VERSION and manifest.json files
   - Finalize CHANGELOG.md with all recent improvements
   - Tag and create GitHub release
   - Verify HACS distribution

2. **Community Engagement**
   - Monitor for user feedback on the reliability improvements
   - Address any edge cases that emerge from wider usage
   - Consider feature requests for future releases

3. **Long-term Maintenance**
   - Monitor Vacasa API for any changes
   - Maintain compatibility with new Home Assistant versions
   - Continue performance optimization as needed
   - Expand test coverage incrementally

4. **Documentation Enhancement**
