# Active Context: Vacasa Home Assistant Integration

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the Vacasa Home Assistant integration that can:
1. Authenticate with Vacasa using username/password
2. Extract and manage authentication tokens
3. Retrieve property information
4. Fetch and categorize reservations by stay type
5. Create calendar entities for each property
6. Provide binary sensors for property occupancy status
7. Support configurable check-in/check-out times

The integration is fully compatible with Home Assistant's async architecture and includes:
- Token caching and refresh
- Robust error handling with retries
- Secure credential management
- Efficient API usage
- User-friendly configuration flow

## Recent Changes

1. **Calendar Implementation**
   - Created calendar entities for each Vacasa property
   - Implemented event generation with proper formatting
   - Added support for different stay types (guest, owner, maintenance)
   - Enhanced event details with check-in/check-out times

2. **Occupancy Sensors**
   - Added binary sensors to show property occupancy status
   - Included attributes for next check-in/check-out
   - Added guest information and reservation type details
   - Implemented proper state management

3. **Configuration Improvements**
   - Added support for configurable check-in/check-out times
   - Implemented per-property configuration
   - Added fallback to defaults when API data is missing
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

4. **Code Quality**
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Implemented consistent logging
   - Added detailed error handling
   - Created deployment script for testing

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on:
1. **Testing**: Ensuring the integration works reliably in real-world scenarios
2. **Documentation**: Improving user documentation and adding example automations
3. **Preparation for Release**: Getting ready for distribution via HACS

## Active Decisions

### Calendar Implementation
We've implemented one calendar per Vacasa property, with events categorized by stay type. This approach:
- Allows for property-specific automations
- Enables filtering by stay type
- Provides a clean, organized UI

### Occupancy Sensors
We've added binary sensors for property occupancy status, which:
- Simplify automation creation based on occupancy
- Provide additional context through attributes
- Work alongside calendars for comprehensive property status

### Check-in/Check-out Times
We've implemented configurable check-in/check-out times that:
- Default to standard times (4 PM check-in, 10 AM check-out)
- Can be customized per property
- Fall back to API data when available
- Handle placeholder times appropriately

### Refresh Strategy
We've implemented a default refresh interval, which:
- Balances freshness of data with API usage
- Can be configured by the user
- Includes a manual refresh service

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Create unit tests for the API client and entities
   - Develop integration tests with Home Assistant
   - Test with real Vacasa accounts in various scenarios

2. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new features
   - Create example automations
   - Add installation guide
   - Document configuration options

3. **Packaging**
   - Prepare for HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
   - Create release process
   - Set up continuous integration

## Open Questions

1. **API Stability**
   - How stable is the Vacasa API? Will it change frequently?
   - Are there any rate limits we need to be aware of?

2. **Error Handling**
   - What's the best way to handle authentication failures in Home Assistant?
   - How should we notify users of API issues?

3. **Additional Features**
   - Should we add more entity types beyond calendars and binary sensors?
   - Would services for manual data refresh be useful?

4. **User Experience**
   - Are there additional configuration options we should expose?
   - How can we make the integration more user-friendly?

## Timeline

- **Current Phase**: Testing and Documentation
- **Next Phase**: Release Preparation
- **Future Phase**: Community Feedback and Maintenance
